### Hi 

You'll find a mix of projects here.

Some I built in my own time for use in my job, and am sharing to help other analysts in the NHS:  

- [runcharter](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/runcharter) (github repository) [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=runcharter)
- [cusumcharter](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/cusumcharter) (github repository) [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cusumcharter)
- [spccharter](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/spccharter)  

Some are built to solve problems that other analysts have raised:  
- [patientcounter](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/patientcounter)  
- [juncture](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/juncture) (this is a revision of {patientcounter})  

Plans for 2022:
- Iâ€™m currently dabbling with Python and Julia, and starting to use Linux more often
